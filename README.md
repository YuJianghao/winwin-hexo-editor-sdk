# @winwin/hexo-editor-server

A koa2 middleware provides hexo editing API.

If you have your own server, and using HEXO for blogging, and looking for an editor that can use anywhere anytime, and ... Bingo! You found it !

I write this project because almost every markdown editor I tried is not convenient enought when writting blog with HEXO. I always have to add tags categories and front-matters mannuly, and run script to generate and deloy(even though it is convenient enough for most people). So I write this one to edit HEXO post in a convenient way by just click click and click.

I also have a SPA hexo-editor-client based on Vue and Quasar.( I promise I'm working on it !‚ù§).

API doc is comming soon... You can find it in `./src/controller.js`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @winwin/hexo-editor-server
```

Or other package manager, such as `yarn`.

## Usage

### Core

- Set `process.env.HEXO_ROOT` to your hexo blog folder, i.e. the same folder as your hexo `_config.yml` file.
- Inside your koa app file, mount hexo-editor-server to app.

```js
// app.js
// mount hexo-editor-server to koa app
hexoeditorserver(app, { base: '/hexo' , auth: /* some authentication middleware */ })

```

- See `./example/app.js` and [document](https://yujianghao.github.io/winwin-hexo-editor-server/module-hexo-editor-serever.html) for more infomation.

### Hexo-cli and Git

- If you want to deploy blog, you need to config your `hexo deploy` and `hexo generate` command. see [HEXO's doc](https://hexo.io/docs/one-command-deployment.html)
- If you want to use Git for backup, you need to config Git repository with a remote origin.

## Options

- `base`: the root url your hexo-editor-server will be runing at. Defulat to `/hexo/`.
- `auth`: a custom authentication koa middleware. Default to `undefined`.
